# DesignPatterns
In this repo, you will find notes and sample code I created while working to deepen my understanding of design patterns.
It's one thing to know about them, but another to really understand them in a very deep way.

### Learning Process

I used the book *Head First Design Patterns* to go over the most common design patterns and see 
examples of each one in use. I found the offbeat and comedic style of the book refreshing and the 
the strong examples illuminating.

### Example Code

All of the code in this repo was created by me without any starters from the book or elsewhere. 
I just thought up a possible use for the pattern and tried it out. Most of the IO and functionality 
of the code is represented by print statements so the focus can be on the pattern and its inner 
workings.

### Completed Patters

Since I'm adding the patterns bit by bit, this repo is definitely a work in progress. Here is a list of 
completed patterns where I've taken some notes *and* have a working code sample.

I'm also jotting down the general design principles that the book spells out. These lead to the 
creation of the standard design patterns and many other good patterns of OOP.
