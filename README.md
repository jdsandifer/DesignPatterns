# DesignPatterns
Notes and sample code I created while working to understand and memorize more design patterns.

### Learning Process

I used the book *Head First Design Patterns* to go over the most common design patterns and see 
examples of each one in use. I found the offbeat and comedic style of the book refreshing and 
illuminating at the same time.

### Example Code

All of the code in this repo was created by me without any starters from the book or elsewhere. 
I just thought up a possible use for the pattern and tried it out. Most of the IO and functionality 
of the code is represented by print statements so the focus can be on the pattern and its inner 
workings rather.
