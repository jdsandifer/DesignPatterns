## The Strategy Pattern
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use in.

In other words, use interfaces so you can use different versions of a behavior 
without changing your code as much. Uses interfaces to allow variations in how 
the same behavior is implemented.
